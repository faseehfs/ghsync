# GHSync

A simple, user-friendly Python CLI application for syncing your GitHub repositories to your local computer.

## Commands

-   `config`: Guides you through the configuration process and saves the settings to `config.json`. Run this again if you need to reconfigure the application.
-   `sync`: Downloads any repositories that havenâ€™t been downloaded yet (including LFS files) and updates existing ones in the sync directory if there are changes. Run this periodically to keep your local copy up to date.
-   `backup`: Compresses your backup directory into a timestamped `.zip` file and deletes the original folder. The next time you run `sync`, repositories are re-downloaded, preventing local corruption.
