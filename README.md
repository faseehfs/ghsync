# GHSync

This is a simple and user-friendly Python program to synchronize your GitHub repositories to your local computer.

## How to Use

Simply run the application, and it will first walk you through the configuration process. Then, it will clone all your repositories into the folder you have configured. Run it periodically to keep your local copy up to date.

## Tips

-   To reconfigure the program, delete `config.json`. The next time you run the app, it will prompt you to reconfigure.
-   You don’t have to configure the app through the app itself—you can also edit `config.json` manually using a text editor.
